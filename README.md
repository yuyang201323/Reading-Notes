# Reading-notes
The following is a place to keep my notes thorugh out the whole course.

## Growth Mindset
My understanding of a growth mindset: Keep moving. One is not limited by what that person has right now, but future potentials.

Reminders:
1. Do not give up.
2. Ok to mistake.
3. Success takes time.
