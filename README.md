This is a place to keep my notes thorugh out the whole course.

## Self-Introduction

My name is Yuyang, with a pronoun He/Him. I have been a Biomed working on  medical equipments for three years. Here is a [link](https://github.com/yuyang201323) about my profile. 

## Growth Mindset

My understanding of a growth mindset: Keep moving. One is not limited by what that person has right now, but future potentials.
